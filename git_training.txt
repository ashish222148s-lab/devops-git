Connection:
    1-Start the git bash client and setup the following configuration within the Git Bash client.
        git config --global user.name "ashish"
        git config --global user.email "ashish222148s@gmail.com"
        git config --global push.default current
        git config --global core.autocrlf true
        git config --global http.sslverify false
    2-Validate the configuration setting using git config--global -l
    3-create an .ssh directory to store the key pair, using the following command:	
        mkdir .ssh
    4-Generate the key pair using the following command :
        ssh-keygen -m PEM -t rsa -b 4096 -C "ashish222148s@gmail.com"
    5-Copy the contents of the ublic key file to configure iton the GitHbto authenticate your git commands.
        cat /.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    6-now move on git hub and paste the pubic key in setting gpg and ssh key part.

    7-Test the connectivity between Git and Github
        ssh -T git@github.com

mkdir git_practice
git init
when we check git status -s here we, will get ??(red) , which tells that there is an untracked files.
git add filename first time. it will only show A(green) when we run command git status -s

Merging: 
    1-Fast Forward merge
    2-Three way merge
Fast Forward Merge:  In fast forward merge , there will be no any extra commit in master / main branch,  only commit will be done in feature branch.  so while merging, only HEAD will be point to the featcher branch latest commit, no extra commit will be there.
Three way merge: In three way merge , featurebranch has some extra commit and then main branch has some more commit , so while merge , therewill be one new commit added by combining the main branch(lwhch comes lower) then feature branch and above these two one more commit 
    will be added.

How to search branch starting with:
    $ git branch -l feature*
    feature_chat
    feature_vedio

Git remote repository:
    git remote -v 
    git remote add origin ssh-url
    (create the ssh key with the command ssh-keygen -t rsa)
    git remote -v 

    git push origin branch_name_local:branch_name_remote

    Note: both branch(local and remote branch will refer to same commit)
    if we add any other commit at local, local branch will be one commit ahead.

    If yo want to change the branch name on remote:
        git push origin feature1:audio-call    #Note: It does not mean that this local branch has bee mapped with remote branch, we just changed the name.

    git branch--will show local branch
    git branch -r-will show remote branch
    git branch -a--will show all branch
    Note: git branch --v --will show which branch is mapped with which branch in remote repository.

VImp: set upstream: while we push he code to remote repo, last time we enter command git push origin master: master
    but we can set the uptream, git push -u origin master, so local branch master will be mapped with the remote master branch.
    Please note that this will only work if he local branch and remote branch have the same name, but will happen if the local and remote branch have the diffrent name.
    Please check git config --get push.default what is mentioned in this, make it as git config push.default upstream

How to delete from remote repo using commna line:
    git push origin --delete brach_name
